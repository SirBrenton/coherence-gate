# 48-Hour Decision Pipeline Pre-Flight  
*Reproducibility • Safety Gates • Proof Pack Spec*  

**$2,500 fixed** • **Async-only** • Delivered in **48 business hours** (after inputs are complete)

## If any of these happened recently, this is for you
- A rerun flipped a decision and nobody could explain why  
- “What exactly ran?” → “we think…”  
- Review/compliance blocked you because artifacts weren’t provable  
- You have an “unsafe mode” risk that relies on human discipline  
- Leadership asked “can we trust this pipeline?” and you didn’t have evidence

## Outcome
In 48 hours you’ll know — **with evidence**:
- where nondeterminism / untracked config can enter
- what can run “by accident” (unsafe modes, missing gates, silent defaults)
- what each run must emit to be reproducible, reviewable, and auditable

Scope is **one declared critical path end-to-end**.

## Deliverables (3 artifacts)
1) **Ranked Risk Register (top 5–10)**  
Evidence → blast radius → smallest fix → acceptance test

2) **Proof Pack v1 Spec**  
The artifact contract your pipeline must emit per run + what CI must enforce

3) **Go / No-Go**  
Can a 5-day single-path hardening sprint succeed next? If **No-Go**, you still get the artifacts.

## Start
- Quick check (5 min): `docs/scorecard.md`  
- Start intake (10 min): `docs/intake.md`  

When I confirm **“Inputs complete,”** the 48-hour clock starts.

> If you can’t share repo access or CI evidence, this converts to an **Evidence Gap Pack** (still delivered in 48h).
