# Coherence Gate

Artifact-led pipeline reliability diagnostics for decision pipelines (CI, analytics, evals).

> **Can your pipeline prove what happened after a run — or are you relying on trust and dashboards?**

## What’s in this repo
One fixed-scope engagement:

- **$2,500 fixed • async-only • delivered in 48 business hours** after inputs are complete  
- Outputs: **Ranked Risk Register**, **Proof Pack v1 Spec**, **Go / No-Go**  
- Scope: **one declared critical path** + **CI evidence** (2–3 runs)

## Start here
- Offer (60–90s read): **[`docs/ci-preflight.md`](docs/ci-preflight.md)**
- Quick self-check (5 min): **[`docs/scorecard.md`](docs/scorecard.md)**
- Intake (10 min): **[`docs/intake.md`](docs/intake.md)**

If you proceed: send the completed intake + repo access/zip + CI run links **in one message**.  
I confirm “Inputs complete,” then the 48-hour clock starts.
