# Coherence Gate

Artifact-led pipeline reliability diagnostics for teams whose CI, analytics, or evaluation systems drive real decisions.

This repository contains a single, opinionated pre-flight diagnostic designed to answer one question:

> **Can your pipeline prove what happened after a run — or are you relying on trust and dashboards?**

---

## Start here

- Read the offer: **[`docs/ci-preflight.md`](docs/ci-preflight.md)**
- Start intake (10 min): **[`docs/intake.md`](docs/intake.md)**
- Async-only. 48 hours starts after inputs are complete.
- If repo/logs can’t be shared → Evidence Gap Pack.

---

## What this is

Coherence Gate is a forensic, asynchronous pre-flight for decision pipelines.

It evaluates whether a system:
- Produces reproducible, reviewable evidence per run
- Blocks unsafe or ambiguous execution modes by default
- Can defend its outputs weeks later under scrutiny

This is **not** a platform, framework, or agent runtime.  
It is a bounded diagnostic artifact.

---

## What you get (deliverables)

- **Ranked Risk Register** (top 5–10 issues with evidence, blast radius, smallest fix, acceptance test)
- **Proof Pack v1 Spec** (the artifact contract your pipeline must emit per run)
- **Go / No-Go** + shortest path to become “Sprint-Ready”

(Full scope and exclusions are in the artifact.)

---

## Who this is for

- Teams running CI, experimentation, ML evals, analytics, pricing, or risk pipelines
- Outputs influence decisions, not just dashboards
- You’ve been blocked by drift, ambiguity, or review/compliance friction

## Who this is not for

- Greenfield projects
- “Just make it faster” requests
- Teams unwilling to evaluate evidence gaps honestly

---

## Engagement model

- Async-only
- Fixed scope, fixed price
- Artifact-first delivery
- No calls, no retainers, no scope creep

---

## Next step

Read the offer:
→ **[`docs/ci-preflight.md`](docs/ci-preflight.md)**

Start the intake (10 minutes):
→ **[`docs/intake.md`](docs/intake.md)**

If you can’t share repo/log evidence, the intake routes to the **Evidence Gap Pack**.
